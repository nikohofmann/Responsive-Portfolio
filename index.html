        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Niko Hofmann and I'm an aspiring web developer currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Utah. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I was born in Idaho to immigrant parents, my father from Germany and my mother from Uruguay. I grew up in Utah, where I lived through high school and my first semester of college before moving to the panhandle of Florida.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I received my Associate's Degree from Northwest Florida State College before returning to Utah and completing my undergraduate degree in Operations Management in May of 2014.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am currently employed as an Implementation Specialist at a local tech company called InMoment.</p>
